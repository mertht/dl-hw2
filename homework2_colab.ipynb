        "1. Just like last time, provide plots for training error, test error, and test accuracy. Also provide a plot of your train and test perplexity per epoch.\n",
        "    - In class we defined perplexity as `2^(p*log_2(q))`, However the PyTorch cross entropy function uses the natural log. To compute perplexity directly from the cross entropy, you should use `e^p*ln(q)`.\n",
        "    - We encourage you to try multiple network modifications and hyperparameters, but you only need to provide plots for your best model. Please list the modifications and hyperparameters.    \n",
        "    \n",
        "2. What was your final test accuracy? What was your final test perplexity?\n",
        "3. What was your favorite sentence generated via each of the sampling methods? What was the prompt you gave to generate that sentence?\n",
        "4. Which sampling method seemed to generate the best results? Why do you think that is?\n",
        "5. For sampling and beam search, try multiple temperatures between 0 and 2. \n",
        "    - Which produces the best outputs? Best as in made the most sense, your favorite, or funniest, doesn't really matter how you decide.\n",
        "    - What does a temperature of 0 do? What does a temperature of 0<temp<1 do? What does a temperature of 1 do? What does a temperature of above 1 do? What would a negative temperature do (assuming the code allowed for negative temperature)?\n",
